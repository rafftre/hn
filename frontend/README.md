# HackerNoon Sample Frontend

This is the frontend of the sample web application.

## Source Code

This project is a React app with a single page. The app has one main container and some components. The container manage the API requests, while the components are dedicated only to presentation aspects.

The CSS styles are defined without the adoption of a design system and without the use of a preprocessor. For that reason they are applied in a minimalist manner - i.e. class names are introduced only when strictly needed, the tag names or the hierarchical structure is used otherwise.
